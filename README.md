# Quiz App

A dynamic quiz app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their knowledge through various questions. The app includes timers, score tracking, and visual feedback on correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.

## Features

- **Timed Quiz:** Each question has a time limit. Once the time runs out, the answer choices are locked.
- **Answer Feedback:** After time runs out, the app displays whether your answer was correct (Green), incorrect (Red), or skipped (Yellow).
- **Dynamic Results:** At the end of the quiz, the total number of correct, incorrect, and skipped answers are displayed.
- **Point System:** Users earn points for each correct answer.
- **Answer Review:** After completing the quiz, you can view your answers categorized as correct, incorrect, or skipped.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be mobile-friendly, making it accessible across all devices.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Quiz:** Begin the quiz by clicking the "Start" button.
2. **Answer Questions:** Choose an answer before the timer runs out. You cannot change your answer once time expires.
3. **Time Runs Out:** Once the timer runs out, you will be unable to select an option, and the app will automatically display the answer.
4. **Results Page:** After completing the quiz, you’ll see a summary of your performance with color-coded results (Green for correct, Red for incorrect, and Yellow for skipped).
5. **Review Results:** You can view detailed answers by clicking on the correct, incorrect, or skipped sections in the results.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the content of the quiz app.
- **CSS3**: Styling the app for a clean, modern design.
- **JavaScript**: Making the app interactive, managing timer, score, and dynamic content updates.

## Rules

- **Answer Visibility:** After the timer runs out, you’ll be able to see if your answer was correct or incorrect.
- **Color Coding:** 
  - Green indicates Correct Answers.
  - Red indicates Incorrect Answers.
  - Yellow indicates Skipped Questions.
- **Total Question Count:** Each section (Correct, Incorrect, Skipped) will show the total number of questions in that category. These counts will update dynamically and be displayed in bold for clarity.
- **Time Limit:** Once the timer runs out, you won’t be able to select any more answers.
- **No Exiting:** You can't exit the quiz while you’re playing.
- **Points:** You’ll earn points for each correct answer.
